# Submission Payload (Version 2)

The payload `version` is currently fixed to `v2`. This is not to be confused with `data_version` which determines the structure of the `data` property within the payload.

Low-level data types:

- All datetimes are expressed using ISO_8601 and are assumed to be normalised to UTC unless a timezone identifier is given.
- All character encoding is UTF-8.
- All boolean responses are matched to a "True" or "False" string representation.
- Unanswered optional questions are not included in submitted responses (i.e. null or empty strings values are NOT included)
